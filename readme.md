## ⚠️ Important Points to Consider

### 1. README Content Requirements

For each GitHub assignment, your `README.md` file should include the following:

- A brief explanation about the assignment  
- At least one image  
- A table (if applicable)  

### 2. Adding Images Correctly

Please **use relative paths** when inserting images. This allows you to push both the image and the README file at the same time.

✅ Recommended format:
```markdown
![Git Download](/img/git-download.png)
```

❌ Not recommended (but still works):
```markdown
![Git Install](https://github.com/username/repo-name/blob/master/img/git-install.png)
Using a full GitHub URL like above requires these extra steps:
-First, push the image
-Then copy the GitHub-hosted image URL
-Finally, update your README with that URL
```
This process creates unnecessary workload.
➡️ To keep it simple, prefer the relative path format whenever possible.
